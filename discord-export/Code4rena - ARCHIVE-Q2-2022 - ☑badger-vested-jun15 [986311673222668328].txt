Do you know where I can find the link to the Hidden Hand Distributor code (`IRewardDistributor`)?

What is the motivation behind `isClaimingBribes`?


[06/17/2022 6:33 PM] alextheentreprenerd
To receive ETH only when we're claiming so we can convert to WETH


[06/17/2022 6:36 PM] scaraven
Is there any reason why you would prevent receiving ETH outside of the claiming period?


[06/17/2022 6:46 PM] alextheentreprenerd
Would rather receive WETH and use ETH exclusively for gas


[06/17/2022 6:47 PM] alextheentreprenerd
also receiving ETH can open up multiple instances in which we're in the `fallback / receive` function while also executing something else, making the code more complicated
